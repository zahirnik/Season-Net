# Season-Net
Season-Net is a deep learning model designed to correct biases in seasonal climate forecasts. It combines a UNet encoder-decoder with ConvLSTM to learn spatial and temporal dependencies, improving the accuracy of variables like temperature by leveraging C3S forecasts and ERA5 reanalysis as reference data.
