README: Data Availability and Download Instructions
==================================================

üìÇ Data Availability
--------------------
The datasets used in this study are sourced from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS), maintained by the 
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Specifically, the data are from:

- Seasonal Forecast ‚Äì Original Single Levels
- Seasonal Forecast ‚Äì Original Pressure Levels

These datasets are freely available to registered users under the Copernicus Terms of Use. Therefore, we do not include any raw data in this repository.

üîó Accessing the Data Yourself
------------------------------
To access and reproduce the datasets, follow the instructions below. You will need to:
1. Create a free account at the CDS Portal (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu).
2. Install the CDS API (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/how-to-api).
3. Configure your `.cdsapirc` file (API key).
4. Use the Python scripts provided below to download the datasets.

üìò Use of ERA5 Data
--------------------
This study also uses ERA5 reanalysis data, provided by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and produced by ECMWF.
ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables.

Users can access ERA5 data through the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS):
